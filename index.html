    The rain had finally stopped, leaving the city washed in that strange, quiet glow that comes after a storm. <br />
    Puddles on the pavement held wobbly reflections of neon signs and crooked lampposts, like tiny distorted worlds underfoot. <br />
    A stray cat, damp but dignified, trotted along the curb as if it had personally negotiated the end of the downpour. <br />
    Somewhere in the distance, a train rumbled past, its low hum mixing with the soft hiss of tires on wet asphalt. <br />
    For a moment, everything felt suspended shops half-lit, clouds slowly unraveling, and the air still cool enough to make you believe <br />
    the day might yet surprise you.
